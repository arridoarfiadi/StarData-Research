## Studying Machine Learning
Here we will go over basic machine learning model, understanding them, and doing a simple project around each one of them. List of topics to expect:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Multi-linear Regression
* Polymonial Regression
* K-Means Clustering
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Clustering
* Decision Tree Classification
* Random Forest Classification
* XGBoost
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Support Vector Machine
* Reinforcement Learning
